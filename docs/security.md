# Security Guidelines

## Overview

QRCLib implements post-quantum cryptographic algorithms that are designed to be secure against both classical and quantum computer attacks. This document outlines security considerations and best practices for using the library.

## Security Features

### Quantum Resistance

- **Kyber**: Lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) that is secure against quantum computer attacks.
- **Dilithium**: Lattice-based digital signature scheme that provides quantum-resistant signatures.
- Both algorithms are NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography finalists.

### Implementation Security

1. **Constant-Time Operations**
   - All sensitive operations are implemented to run in constant time
   - Prevents timing attacks that could leak secret information
   - Uses constant-time comparison for signature verification

2. **Secure Random Number Generation**
   - Uses Python's `secrets` module for cryptographically secure randomness
   - Avoids using the standard `random` module which is not cryptographically secure
   - Implements proper seeding and entropy gathering

3. **Memory Management**
   - Sensitive data is overwritten when no longer needed
   - Avoids leaving secret keys in memory
   - Implements proper error handling to prevent information leaks

## Best Practices

### Key Management

1. **Key Generation**
   - Generate new keys for each session/use case
   - Store private keys securely
   - Never reuse nonces or random values

2. **Key Storage**
   - Use secure key storage mechanisms
   - Encrypt private keys at rest
   - Implement proper access controls

3. **Key Distribution**
   - Use secure channels for key distribution
   - Verify key authenticity
   - Implement proper key rotation policies

### Message Signing

1. **Message Preparation**
   - Hash messages before signing
   - Use constant-time operations
   - Validate input data

2. **Signature Verification**
   - Always verify signatures before trusting messages
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use constant-time comparison

### Error Handling

1. **Secure Error Messages**
   - Do not leak sensitive information in error messages
   - Use generic error messages for security-related failures
   - Implement proper logging without exposing secrets

2. **Exception Handling**
   - Catch and handle all exceptions properly
   - Do not expose internal state in exceptions
   - Maintain security invariants during error conditions

## Security Recommendations

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**
   - Review security-critical code thoroughly
   - Follow secure coding guidelines
   - Use static analysis tools

2. **Testing**
   - Implement comprehensive test suites
   - Include security-focused test cases
   - Test error handling paths

3. **Documentation**
   - Document security assumptions
   - Provide clear security guidelines
   - Keep documentation up to date

### For Users

1. **Configuration**
   - Use appropriate security parameters
   - Follow recommended key sizes
   - Implement proper key management

2. **Integration**
   - Use the library as intended
   - Do not modify security-critical code
   - Keep the library updated

3. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor for security issues
   - Implement proper logging
   - Have an incident response plan

## Known Limitations

1. **Side-Channel Attacks**
   - While we implement constant-time operations, the library may still be vulnerable to some side-channel attacks
   - Hardware-level attacks are not addressed
   - Cache timing attacks may still be possible

2. **Implementation Constraints**
   - Pure Python implementation may be slower than optimized C/C++ versions
   - Memory usage may be higher than optimal
   - Some operations may not be fully constant-time due to Python limitations

## Security Updates

1. **Version Control**
   - All security fixes are documented
   - Security patches are clearly marked
   - Version numbers follow semantic versioning

2. **Security Advisories**
   - Security issues are published as advisories
   - CVEs are assigned when appropriate
   - Users are notified of security updates

3. **Reporting Security Issues**
   - Report security issues privately
   - Use responsible disclosure
   - Contact maintainers directly for security concerns

## Compliance

1. **Standards**
   - Follows NIST post-quantum cryptography standards
   - Implements FIPS-compliant random number generation
   - Adheres to cryptographic best practices

2. **Auditing**
   - Code is open for security audits
   - Changes are reviewed for security impact
   - Security issues are tracked and resolved
